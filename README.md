IsoVoxel
========

Generates isometric pixel art from MagicaVoxel .vox files.

Usage
=====

From the command line, use `IsoVoxel.exe file.vox x y z` where file.vox was saved from MagicaVoxel, and x, y, and z are the bounds of the file (Defaults are all 40 if you don't include x y z, and if you don't give a .vox file it defaults to Truck.vox , which is included.  The bounds can all be increased up to a max of approximately 128).  It needs .NET 3.5 or higher, and has been confirmed at least once to work on Mono.
