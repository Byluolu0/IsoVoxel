IsoVoxel
========

Generates isometric pixel art from MagicaVoxel .vox files.

Usage
=====

`IsoVoxel.exe file.vox x y z` where file.vox was exported from MagicaVoxel using a default palette, and x, y, and z are the bounds of the file (Defaults are all 20, but MagicaVoxel will for some reason allow 21 by default for x.  They can all be increased up to 32 or 128 for z).
